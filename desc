Built in Functions
1. glutInit ()
glutInit is used to initialize the GLUT library.
Usage: void glutInit (int *argc, char **argv);
Description: glutInit will initialize the GLUT library and negotiate a session with the
window system.
2. glutInitDisplayMode ()
glutInitDisplayMode sets the initial display mode.
Usage: void glutInitDisplayMode (unsigned int mode);
Mode-Display mode, normally the bitwise OR-ing GLUT display mode bit masks.

Description: The initial display mode is used when creating top-level windows, sub-
windows, and overlays to determine the OpenGL display mode for the to-be created

window or overlay.
3. glutCreateWindow ()
glutCreateWindow creates a top-level window.
Usage: intglutCreateWindow (char *name);
Name-ASCII character string for use as window name
Description: glutCreateWindow creates a top-level window. The name will be
provided to the window system as the windowâ€™s name. The intent is that the window
system will label the window with the name. Implicitly, the current window is set to the
newly created window.
Each created window has a unique associated OpenGL context.
4. glutDisplayFunc ()
glutDisplayFunc sets the display call-back for the current window.
Usage: void glutDisplayFunc (void(*func) (void));
Func: The new display callback function.
Description: glutDisplayFunc sets the display callback for the current window. When
GLUT determines that the normal plane for the window needs to be redisplayed, the
display callback for the window is called. Before the callback, the current window is set
